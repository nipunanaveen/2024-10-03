    <h1><b>Rugby Union</b></h1>
    <p>
        Rugby union football, commonly known simply as rugby union or more often just rugby, is a close-contact team
        sport that originated at Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century. Rugby is based on
        running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each,
        using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.

                rugby, Football sport made up of two variant codes—rugby union and rugby league. The sport was first
                developed in the 1820s at Rugby School in England. In 1895 a dispute over professionalism between the
                Rugby Football Union and several clubs in northern England led to the creation of rugby league (always a
                professional sport). Rugby union became fully professional in 1995. The game is played by teams of 15
                (union) or 13 (league) members each, using an inflated oval ball. The ball may be kicked, carried, or
                passed laterally or backward (but not forward). The object is to score goals (worth three points) by
                kicking the ball between the uprights of the opponent’s goal, or tries (worth five points in union play,
                four in league), by grounding the ball behind the opponent’s goal line. A conversion kick (worth two
                points) is attempted after scoring a try. Both rugby union and rugby league have international play and
                world cup tournaments. Rugby is most popular in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New
                Zealand.

                <br>
                Origins
                <br>
                <br>
                Different forms of football have existed for centuries. (For more on the development of football sports,
                see football.) In Britain, football games may have been played as early as the time of Roman occupation
                in the 1st century bce. During the 14th and 15th centuries ce, Shrove Tuesday football matches became
                annual traditions in local communities, and many of these games continued well into the 19th century.
                These localized versions of folk football (a violent sport distinctive for its large teams and lack of
                rules) gradually found favour within the English public (independent) schools, where they were modified
                and adapted into one of two forms: a dribbling game, played primarily with the feet, that was promoted
                at Eton and Harrow, and a handling game favoured by Rugby, Marlborough, and Cheltenham.
                <br>
                <br>
                Game playing, particularly football, was encouraged at Rugby School by influential headmaster Thomas
                Arnold (1828–42), and many boys educated at this time were instrumental in the expansion of the game.
                Rugby football soon became one of the most significant sports in the promotion of English and, later,
                British imperial manliness. The game’s virtues were promoted by books such as Thomas Hughes’s Tom
                Brown’s School Days (1857). The cult of manliness that resulted centred on the public schools and the
                Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where boys were sent to learn how to become young gentlemen. Part
                of the schoolboy’s training was a commitment to arduous physical activity, and, by the late 19th
                century, rugby and cricket had become the leading sports that developed the “civilized” manly behaviour
                of the elite. It was believed that rugby football instilled in the “muscular Christian” gentleman the
                values of unselfishness, fearlessness, teamwork, and self-control. Graduates of these public schools and
                of Oxford and Cambridge formed the first football clubs, which led to the institutionalization of rugby.
                <br>
                Once they had left school, many young men wanted to continue playing the game of their youth, and the
                early annual matches between alumni and current senior students were not enough to satisfy these
                players. Football clubs were formed in the mid-19th century, with one of the very first rugby clubs
                appearing at Blackheath in 1858. Rugby enthusiasm also spread rapidly to Ireland and Scotland, with a
                club founded at the University of Dublin in 1854 and the formation by the Old Boys of Edinburgh of the
                Edinburgh Academicals Rugby Football Club in 1858. In 1863 the tradition of club matches began in
                England with Blackheath playing Richmond.

                Representatives of several leading football clubs met in 1863 to try to devise a common set of rules
                for football. Disputes arose over handling the ball and “hacking,” the term given to the tactics of
                tripping an opponent and kicking his shins. Both handling and hacking were allowed under rugby’s rules
                but disallowed in other forms of football. Led by F.W. Campbell of Blackheath, the rugby men refused to
                budge over hacking, calling those against the practice “unmanly.” Though Campbell’s group was in the
                minority, it refused to agree to the rules established for the new Football Association (FA) even though
                many elements of rugby rules were included in early compromises. Ultimately, rugby was left outside the
                FA. Despite the initial reluctance to abandon hacking, rugby clubs began to abolish the practice during
                the late 1860s. Blackheath banned it in 1865, and Richmond supported a similar prohibition in 1866.

                        <p>In Wales rugby clubs were established as town clubs in both large communities and small
                            mining towns during the 1870s and ’80s. Many early players had some experience of the game
                            in the north of England and took their interest with them to Wales. By the early 1880s rugby
                            had become a vital part of working-class culture in south Wales, which distinguished the
                            game there from its upper-class association in other parts of the British Isles. Wales had
                            high levels of immigration in the late 19th century, and rugby emerged at this time as a
                            focal point of a new modern Welsh nationalism. As a result, the Welsh Rugby Union formed in
                            1881, and Wales soon entered the Home Championship, competing with England, Ireland, and
                            Scotland. Wales won its first title in 1893. Unlike England, a more competitive system arose
                            in Wales, with a South Wales Challenge Cup being contested between 1878 and 1897 and an
                            unofficial league system appearing by the 1930s. As the only team to defeat the powerful New
                            Zealand team on its first tour of the British Isles, in 1905, Wales cemented its place as a
                            dominant rugby power.</p>

                        <p>Rugby union football spread more slowly outside the British Empire, though it was played in
                            France as early as 1870. There were 20 or more French clubs by 1892, mostly in and around
                            Paris. Soon the game diffused to southwestern cities such as Bordeaux, Lyon, and Perpignon,
                            where it became the most popular team sport. France joined the British Home Championship in
                            1910 to create the Five Nations Championship. In France the game was governed by the Union
                            des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques, a multisports group, from 1887 and by the
                            French Rugby Federation from 1920.</p>

                            the country. The Italian Rugby Federation was founded in 1928. In the 1980s clubs supported
                            by large companies began to organize payment of players in their club competition, and
                            leading international players such as Naas Botha of South Africa, David Campese of
                            Australia, and John Kirwin of New Zealand played rugby union in Italy. Italian rugby
                            advanced significantly by the 1990s, and in 2000 Italy joined the Five Nations competition,
                            which was then renamed Six Nations.</p>

                        <b>Canada and the United States</b>
                        <p>Rugby rules appeared in North America before the 1870s and were used in a famous game between
                            McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1874.
                            In 1876 representatives of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia universities formed the
                            Intercollegiate Football Association, which, in general, agreed with the RFU’s 1871 rules.
                            Rugby rules were soon modified in the United States and later in Canada, however, to create
                            the distinct codes of gridiron football played in North America. Although gridiron football
                            had largely supplanted both association football and rugby in the United States by late in
                            the 19th century, rugby enjoyed a revival from 1905 on the Pacific Coast after gridiron
                            football was banned there in the aftermath of a public furor over violence and player deaths
                            and injuries. Rugby remained popular there after the gridiron sport was restored to its
                            preeminent position. West Coast players largely made up the national rugby teams that won at
                            the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games, after which rugby was dropped as an Olympic sport. Rugby
                            also retained a foothold in British Columbia in Canada. Into the 21st century a large
                            proportion of players on the U.S. and Canadian national teams came from the West Coast
                            region.</p>

                        <b>Australia</b>
                        <p>In Australia the game was closely associated with the eastern coastal region. The Southern
                            Rugby Football Union was formed in Sydney in 1874. Only five clubs played in Sydney at that
                            time, but by 1900, 79 clubs existed, with a senior and four junior competitions. The
                            Metropolitan Rugby Union, later the New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU), was founded in 1897
                            to administer league competitions in Sydney and devised a district system that led to
                            increased spectator interest. By the 1880s matches between teams representing New South
                            Wales and New Zealand began, as rugby in Australia remained largely confined to the big east
                            coast cities of Sydney and Brisbane. The national Australian Rugby Union was not formed
                            until 1949. In other parts of Australia, Australian rules football had already established
                            itself as the dominant sport.</p>

                        <p>In New Zealand the first rugby match was played at Nelson in 1870. However, rugby spread
                            slowly owing to problems of distance and sparse population, and while regional unions
                            appeared throughout the country by the mid-1880s, a national union, the New Zealand Rugby
                            Football Union (NZRFU), was not founded until 1892. A New Zealand “Natives” tour (1888–89)
                            of Australia and the British Isles was organized by an entrepreneur keen to exploit British
                            perceptions of the “exotic” Maori population of New Zealand. A team made up mostly of Maori
                            players toured Britain, winning 49 of its 74 matches, including many matches against clubs
                            in the north of England that largely consisted of working-class players and that had become
                            the best club teams in the country. In 1902 the Ranfurly Shield was presented by Earl
                            Ranfurly, the governor of New Zealand, to serve as a trophy for a challenge competition
                            between provincial rugby teams. The shield remains one of the most prized trophies in New
                            Zealand’s domestic competition. In 1903 New Zealand played a truly national Australian team
                            for the first time. New Zealand’s national team, known as the All Blacks for their black
                            uniforms, defeated a visiting British national team in 1904, and on the All Blacks first
                            tour of Britain, France, and North America the following year, they posted a stunning 34–1
                            record. Success in international rugby supported by strong domestic teams formed the
                            backbone of New Zealand rugby and cemented its place as the country’s top sport.</p>
